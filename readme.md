# Manhattan

Named after the greatest grid system in the world, Manhattan is a clean, lightweight and customisable CSS grid. It uses it's own data-attribute `mhtn` keeping your class markup clean.

It offers three containers, the default restricts content on screens over a specified width, whereas flex and edge allow you to maximize any screen.

Manhattan doesn't use a traditional 12 column layout, but instead opts for straight forward percentages. There are five breakpoints for total control over your layout, where you can specify a width for each column at each screen size.

Manhattan supports all modern browsers and most older ones, including IE 8 with the help of a media query polyfill.


## Why?

There is no shortage of CSS grids available and with so many frameworks offering everything you need, it can be hard to know which use, or if any. Pre-styled and assembled from components, I see too many websites lacking creativity and imagination. Although a grid isn't necessary either, it can be a useful tool for speeding up development without interrupting your website's personality.

I struggled to find a flexible grid without a heavy footprint, so I created Manhattan. It's ultra light, weighing in at 2.8 kb minified/658 bytes gzipped and released under the <a href="<?php echo get_home_url(); ?>/license/">MIT license</a>, free to use and abuse.


Enjoy
